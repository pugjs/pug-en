# Template Inheritance

Pug supports template inheritance. Template inheritance works via the `block` and `extends` keywords. 

In a template, a `block` is simply a "block" of Pug that a child template may replace. This process is recursive.

Pug blocks can provide default content, if appropriate. Providing default content is purely optional, though. The example below defines `block scripts`, `block content`, and `block foot`.  

```pug
//- layout.pug
html
  head
    title My Site - #{title}
    block scripts
      script(src='/jquery.js')
  body
    block content
    block foot
      #footer
        p some footer content
```

To extend this layout, create a new file and use the `extends` directive with a path to the parent template. (If no file extension is given, `.pug` is automatically appended to the file name.) Then, define one or more blocks to override the parent block content. 

Below, notice that the `foot` block is *not* redefined, so it will use the parent's default and output "some footer content".

```pug
//- page-a.pug
extends layout.pug

block scripts
  script(src='/jquery.js')
  script(src='/pets.js')

block content
  h1= title
  - var pets = ['cat', 'dog']
  each petName in pets
    include pet.pug
```

```pug
//- pet.pug
p= petName
```

It's also possible to override a block to provide additional blocks, as shown in the following example. As it shows, `content` now exposes a `sidebar` and `primary` block for overriding. (Alternatively, the child template could override `content` altogether.)

```pug
//- sub-layout.pug
extends layout.pug

block content
  .sidebar
    block sidebar
      p nothing
  .primary
    block primary
      p nothing
```

```pug
//- page-b.pug
extends sub-layout.pug

block content
  .sidebar
    block sidebar
      p nothing
  .primary
    block primary
      p nothing
```

## Block `append` / `prepend`

Pug allows you to `replace` (default), `prepend`, or `append` blocks. 

Suppose you have default scripts in a `head` block that you wish to use on *every* page. You might do this:

```pug
//- layout.pug
html
  head
    block head
      script(src='/vendor/jquery.js')
      script(src='/vendor/caustic.js')
  body
    block content
```

Now, consider a page of your JavaScript game. You want some game related scripts as well as these defaults. You can simply `append` the block:

```pug
//- page.pug
extends layout.pug

block append head
  script(src='/vendor/three.js')
  script(src='/game.js')
```

When using `block append` or `block prepend`, the word “`block`” is optional:

```pug
//- page.pug
extends layout.pug

append head
  script(src='/vendor/three.js')
  script(src='/game.js')
```

## Common mistakes

Pug's template inheritance is a powerful feature that allows you to split complex page template structures into smaller, simpler files. However, if you chain many, many templates together, you can make things a lot more complicated for yourself.

Note that **only named blocks and mixin definitions** can appear at the top (unindented) level of a child template. This is important! Parent templates define a page's overall structure, and child templates can only `append`, `prepend`, or replace specific blocks of markup and logic. If a child template tried to add content outside of a block, Pug would have no way of knowing where to put it in the final page.

This includes [unbuffered code](code.html#unbuffered-code), which can also contain markup. If you need to define variables for use in a child template, you can do so a few different ways:

* Add the variables to the Pug [options](../api/reference.html#options) object, or define them in unbuffered code in a parent template. The child template will inherit these variables.
* Define the variables *in a block* in the child template. Extending templates must have at least one block, or it would be empty --- just define your variables there.

For the same reason, Pug's [buffered comments](comments.html) cannot appear at the top level of an extending template: they produce HTML comments which would have nowhere to go in the resulting HTML. (Unbuffered Pug comments, however, can still go anywhere.)
