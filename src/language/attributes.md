# Attributes

Tag attributes look similar to HTML (with optional commas), but their values are just regular JavaScript.

(NOTE: Examples on this page use the pipe character (`|`) for [whitespace control](plain-text.html#whitespace-control).)

```pug-preview
a(href='//google.com') Google
|
|
a(class='button' href='//google.com') Google
|
|
a(class='button', href='//google.com') Google
```

Normal JavaScript expressions work fine, too:

```pug-preview
- var authenticated = true
body(class=authenticated ? 'authed' : 'anon')
```

## Multiline Attributes

If you have many attributes, you can also spread them across many lines:

```pug-preview
input(
  type='checkbox'
  name='agreement'
  checked
)
```

If your JavaScript runtime supports ES2015 [template strings] (including Node.js/io.js 1.0.0 and later), you can use that syntax for attributes. This is really useful for attributes with really long values:

```pug-preview (features=['templatestrings'])
input(data-json=`
  {
    "very-long": "piece of ",
    "data": true
  }
`)
```

## Quoted Attributes

If your attribute name contains odd characters that might interfere with JavaScript syntax, either quote it using `""` or `''`, or use commas to separate different attributes. Examples of such characters include `[]` and `()` (frequently used in Angular 2).

```pug-preview
//- In this case, `(click)` is treated as a
//- function call instead of a attribute name,
//- resulting in the unusual error.
div(class='div-class' (click)='play()')
```

```pug-preview
div(class='div-class', (click)='play()')
div(class='div-class' '(click)'='play()')
```

## Attribute Interpolation

::: float danger Caution
Previous versions of Pug/Jade supported an interpolation syntax such as:

```pug
a(href="/#{url}") Link
```

This syntax is **no longer supported.** Alternatives are found below. (Check our [migration guide] for more information on other incompatibilities between Pug v2 and previous versions.)
:::

Here are some alternatives you can use to include variables in your attribute:

1. Simply write the attribute in JavaScript:

   ```pug-preview
   - var url = 'pug-test.html';
   a(href='/' + url) Link
   |
   |
   - url = 'https://example.com/'
   a(href=url) Another link
   ```

2. If your JavaScript runtime supports ES2015 [template strings] (including Node.js/io.js 1.0.0 and later), you can also use its syntax to simplify your attributes:

   ```pug-preview (features=['templatestrings'])
   - var btnType = 'info'
   - var btnSize = 'lg'
   button(type='button' class='btn btn-' + btnType + ' btn-' + btnSize)
   |
   |
   button(type='button' class=`btn btn-${btnType} btn-${btnSize}`)
   ```

## Unescaped Attributes

By default, all attributes are escaped&mdash;that is,special characters are replaced with escape sequences&mdash;to prevent attacks (such as cross site scripting).  If you need to use special characters, use `!=` instead of `=`.

```pug-preview
div(escaped="<code>")
div(unescaped!="<code>")
```

::: float danger Caution
**Unescaped buffered code can be dangerous.** You must be sure to sanitize any user inputs to avoid [cross-site scripting].
:::

## Boolean Attributes

Boolean attributes are mirrored by Pug. Boolean values (`true` and `false`) are accepted. When no value is specified `true` is assumed.

```pug-preview
input(type='checkbox' checked)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=true)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=false)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=true.toString())
```

If the doctype is `html`, Pug knows not to mirror the attribute, and instead uses the terse style (understood by all browsers).

```pug-preview
doctype html
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=true)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=false)
|
|
input(type='checkbox' checked=true && 'checked')
```

## Style Attributes

The `style` attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute; but it can also be an object, which is handy when styles are generated by JavaScript.


```pug-preview
a(style={color: 'red', background: 'green'})
```

## Class Attributes

The `class` attribute can be a string, like any normal attribute; but it can also be an array of class names, which is handy when generated from JavaScript.

```pug-preview
- var classes = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
a(class=classes)
|
|
//- the class attribute may also be repeated to merge arrays
a(class=classes class=['bing'])
```

It can also be an object which maps class names to `true` or `false` values. This is useful for applying conditional classes

```pug-preview
- var currentUrl = '/about'
a(class={active: currentUrl === '/'} href='/') Home
|
|
a(class={active: currentUrl === '/about'} href='/about') About
```

## Class Literal

Classes may be defined using a `.classname` syntax:

```pug-preview
a.button.important
```

Since `div`'s are such a common choice of tag, it is the default if you omit the tag name:

```pug-preview
.content.admin
```

## Class Literal and Attributes used together
These can be pulled together in a massive, highly readable, element defining Class Chain of Doom.

```pug-preview
- var classes = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
- var currentUrl = '/about'
a.bang.bong(class=classes class=['bing'] class={active: currentUrl === '/about'} href='/about') About
```


## ID Literal

IDs may be defined using a `#idname` syntax:

```pug-preview
a#main-link
```

Since `div`'s are such a common choice of tag, it is the default if you omit the tag name:

```pug-preview
#content
```

## &attributes

Pronounced as "and attributes", the `&attributes` syntax can be used to explode an object into attributes of an element.

```pug-preview
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes({'data-foo': 'bar'})
```

The above example uses an object literal. But you can also use a variable whose value is an object, too. (See also: [Mixin Attributes]).

```pug-preview
- var attributes = {};
- attributes.class = 'baz';
div#foo(data-bar="foo")&attributes(attributes)
```

::: float danger Caution
**Attributes applied using `&attributes` are not automatically escaped.** You must be sure to sanitize any user inputs to avoid [cross-site scripting] (XSS). If passing in `attributes` from a mixin call, this is done automatically.
